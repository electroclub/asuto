<h2>Appointment of components of system.</h2>
<p class="level3">
The personal computer with the light editor is intended for input, storage and reproduction of the light score.
The printer is intended for a conclusion to the paper carrier of the text documentation
the score, the comment, the report of conducting performance).
The UPS is intended for maintenance with power supplies of components of system for the purpose
of an exception of possibility of their exit out of operation at short-term loss of pressure
in the electric system.
</p>
<p class="level3">
The control console is intended by for input of parameters of management by light sources and
their transfer to the personal computer on the interface DMX 512.
</p>
<p class="level3">
The two-directed specialised adapter of the interface (USB - DMX512) is intended for reception
from the panel and transfer to dimmers control information by interface DMX512,
information interchange by the interface USB with the personal computer.
</p>
<p class="level3">
The complete set of cables is intended for information interchange between components of system,
giving of power energy on system elements.
</p>
<h1>CONNECTION</h1>
<p class="level2">
System connection is carried out as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Connect computer components according to the documentation on the computer.
</li>
<li>Connect the printer to the computer according to the documentation on the printer.
</li>
<li>Connect the output "DMX 512 OUT" the console to an input "DMX 512 IN" of the adapter.
</li>
<li>Connect the output "DMX 512 OUT" of the adapter to an interface cable "DMX 512 IN"
which on the other hand is connected to dimmers.
</li>
<li>Connect the output "USB" of the computer to an input "USB" of the adapter.
</li>
<li>Connect inputs "~220В, 50 Hz" of the computer, the printer and the console
to output "~220В, 50 Hz" of the UPS.
</li>
<li>Connect input "~220В, 50 Hz" of the UPS to power net "~220В, 50 Hz".
</li>
</ul>
<h1>SYSTEM ON/OFF.</h1>
<p class="level2">
System ON is carried out in the following sequence:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Include a power of the UPS according to the documentation;
</li>
<li>Include a power of the personal computer;
</li>
<li>Include a power of control console (if necessary);
</li>
<li>Include a power of the printer (if necessary).
</li>
</ul>
<p class="level2">System OFF is carried out in the following sequence:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Switch off a power of the printer;
</li>
<li>Switch off a power of the console;
</li>
<li>Switch off a power of the personal computer;
</li>
<li>Switch off a power of the UPS.
</li>
</ul>
<h1>OPERATING MODES.</h1>
<p class="level2">Depending on requirement the system works in three basic modes:
</p>
<ul>
<li>1 - Introduction and performance of the score from the control console and the light editor of the computer;
</li>
<li>2 - score Performance only from the control console (BYPASS)
with introduction and score formation in the light editor of the computer;
</li>
<li>3 - Introduction and score performance only from the light editor of the computer.
</li>
</ul>
<p class="level2">In mode 1 information on a condition of regulators by the interface
"DMX 512" arrives from the control console in the computer.
Thus the light editor on commands of the operator in real time interprets it as a condition
1-48, 49-96.
Etc. regulation channels, or a condition of smooth regulators of management of the score (to 48) - group,
the general, smooth regulators of management of transitions between pictures forward and back under the score,
rate of performance of the score.
And at quantity of entrance channels from the panel - to 48, the quantity of target adjustable channels
can reach 512 if necessary.
</p>
<p>
The light editor carries out reception of the information from the control console,
automatic formation, storage and listing of the light score.
</p>
<p class="level2">
In mode 2 performances of the score is carried out directly from the control console,
but with introduction and score formation in the light editor.
Thus the information is transferred from an input "DMX 512 IN" to an exit "DMX 512 OUT"
the adapter, in parallel arriving in the computer for score formation.</p>
<p class="level2">
In mode 3 performances of the score is carried out from the light editor without
obligatory presence of the external control console.
</p>
<p class="level2">The control system of scene light provides:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Formation, storage, updating and performance of light scores of performances;</li>
<li>Dynamics of change of pictures;</li>
<li>Creation and performance of light effects;</li>
<li>Documentation registration on performance (the score, the comment,
 the plan of an arrangement of light sources and the report of conducting performance).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Technical characteristics</h2>
<p class="level3">
System technical characteristics are defined by technical characteristics of components of system
which are resulted in the corresponding documentation.
